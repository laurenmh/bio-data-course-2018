## Please submit both a "cleaned-up, report-worthy"" html or pdf AND an "all work shown, echo = TRUE" html or pdf

## Points: 35

## Final project objective
The objective of the final project will be to complete a fully reproducible workflow that uses data to address your chosen question. The project must illustrate all of the following tasks:

* Some form of data access / reading into R
* Use of dplyr to manipulate and summarize the data in relevant ways
* Initial data visualization with ggplot2
* Final, publication-worthy visualization with ggplot2
* RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as both a clean html or pdf file, and a "show your under-the-hood work" version of the file
*  Overall clean and clear presentation of the workflow, code, and explanation



### I. Introduction (Literature review)
The literature review will be around 5 well cited paragraphs that do the following:

__1. Introduce the problem and explain why__  

* Set the stage for the problem  
* Put the concept and question into context  
* Lots of big-picture citations (such as reviews) in the first paragraph  

__2. Past work and data available on the project__

- Who has addressed this problem, and what did they do it?  
- What are the data available to address this problem?  
- How has the data available and/or methods changed recently?  

__3. Purpose of the study__

- Further refine your approach (e.g., what data will you combine, how will you address the question)  
- Justify why this is needed now (e.g., visualization to test a new dimension of the question or better convey an old one)

__4. Hypotheses/questions__

- Describe these clearly and in a logical order  
- Make hypotheses directionally using predictions (e.g. "I predict N will reduce plant diversity" rather than "I predict N will change plant diversity")
   
   
### II. Approach/Methods
- Provide a description of the data sources, including who collected the data and how it was collected  
- Describe how you will use the data to address your questions  
- Include R chunks with data import, data tidying, and any important preliminary visualizations (for the "cleaned up" version these will be in non-exported R code chunks; they should be shown in the "all work shown" version)


### III. Results
- Report the key findings (but save the interpretation and contextualization for the discussion)  
- Provide evidence to answer all questions or hypotheses posed in the introduction  
- Include R chunks that contain data summaries and visualizations (all shown in the "all work shown" version; only final tables and figures in the "cleaned-up, report worth" version) 
- Have these chunks export captioned, publication-worthy figures 

### IV. Discussion
The discussion will be around 3-5 well-cited paragraphs that do the following:

1. Provide a big overview or summary of consequences of strongest results (1 paragraph)    
2. Expand thoughts on results and hypothesis (2-4 paragraphs)  
3. Discuss the limitations of the approach a/o potential future directions (1 paragraph)   
4. Summarize the conclusion or take home message (1-2 paragraphs)    

#### Goals for this section include:
* Address hypotheses (are they resolved?), questions, aims, and/or limitations
* Discuss the consequences or implications of results
* Make comparisons with previous findings (support or contradict)
* Announce your study’s contribution to the current field
* Draw broader conclusions
* The comprehensive literature review should be in the introduction, here it is necessary to link to past work but no need to introduce too many new citations

### V. Literature cited
  - At least 10 relevant, peer-reviewed citations  
   - Citations are scientifically formatted (e.g., follow conventions for the journal _Ecology_)
