## Final project objective
The objective of the final project will be to complete a fully reproducible workflow that uses data to address your chosen question. The project must illustrate all of the following tasks:

* Some form of data access / reading into R
* Integration of multiple datasets to address the question
* Use of dplyr to manipulate and summarize the data in relevant ways
* Initial data visualization with ggplot2
* Final, publication-worthy visualization with ggplot2
* RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as both a clean html or pdf file, and a "show your under-the-hood work" version of the file
*  Overall clean and clear presentation of the workflow, code, and explanation


## Intermediate step: Literature review and workflow plan
To progress toward the final project, please prepare a literature review, identify a dataset and develop a workflow plan. A description of each is below. We will peer-review these prior to the final project to help each other with the workflows.

### I. Literature review  
The literature review will be at least 5 well cited paragraphs that do the following:  

__1. Introduce the problem and explain why__  

* Set the stage for the problem  
* Put the concept and question into context  
* Lots of big-picture citations (such as reviews) in the first paragraph  

__2. Past work and data available on the project__

- Who has addressed this problem, and what did they do it?  
- What are the data available to address this problem?  
- How has the data available and/or methods changed recently?  

__3. Purpose of the study__

- Further refine your approach (e.g., what data will you combine, how will you address the question)  
- Justify why this is needed now (e.g., visualization to test a new dimension of the question or better convey an old one)

__4. Hypotheses/questions__

- Describe these clearly and in a logical order  
- Make hypotheses directionally using predictions (e.g. "I predict N will reduce plant diversity" rather than "I predict N will change plant diversity")

__5. Literatured cited__

   - At least 10 relevant, peer-reviewed citations  
   - Citations are scientifically formatted (e.g., follow conventions for the journal _Ecology_)

### II. Dataset identification
Please describe the data you have chosen to address your question such that your peer reviewers will be able to follow your workflow. Describe sufficient metadata to convey who collected the data, how it was collected, and what each column contains. In addition, please provide an overview of the structure of the datasets (give as much information about the data as the str() function would return).

### III. Workflow plan
In English, please describe the workflow you will use tidy your raw data, manipulate and summarize it in relevant ways, and visualize it. Please include any QAQC steps (e.g., "remove non-species such as 'miscellaneous litter' from the species column") as well as aggregation steps (e.g., "count the number of entries by plot and year to calculate species richness"). The goal here is to develop a logic to your workflow before you code.
