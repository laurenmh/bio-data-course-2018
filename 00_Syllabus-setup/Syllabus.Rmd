#### BIO 410/510 | Winter 2020 | Klamath 5 | MF 12:00 - 1:20 am | 4 credits

##Overview
This course covers the non-statistical aspects of the data life cycle, including how to store, clean, visualize and communicate data (Figure 1). It is intended as a complement to statistics courses - we will cover how to get your data into shape for analysis, and how to communicate your findings visually. It is primarily a methods class and will be taught in R (but there is no expectation that students know R coming in).

This course satisfies the "Analytical Approaches" requirement for Environmental Science majors. 

**Instructor**: **Dr Lauren Hallett** is a plant community ecologist specializing in ecological restoration.  
**Email**: hallett@uoregon.edu *Please include BIO 410/510 in email subject lines*  
**Office**: Pacific Hall 220  
**Office hours**: Tu 2-4 pm and by appointment 


[**Canvas site**](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/courses/119970): Our website is accessible via the UO Canvas server, use your UO email and password to access the site. Problem sets will be distributed and submitted via Canvas. https://canvas.uoregon.edu/

**How I will contact you**: My communication to you outside of class will take place via Canvas email. 

##Course material
Our primary course material will be **R for Data Science** by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, which is available for free online (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). I will post other readings to Canvas. Please make sure to read book sections and papers before the class in which they are assigned. 

##Objectives
By completing this course, students will be able to:  
1) Interpret figures in scientific papers and popular media  
2) Locate data relevant to biological and environmental questions  
3) Understand the steps linking raw data to communicated findings  
4) Create exploratory and publication-worthy graphs  

##Structure of the course
This class combines lectures on topics in data science and in-class exercises.

##Class assignments and requirements
There are two main components required for successful completion of the course.

**A. Problem sets** Problem sets are designed to develop the skills you learn in class and to gain comfort in the R environment through practice. Problem sets will typically include designing and implementing code and interpreting code and figures. There will be four problem sets, to be submitted on Canvas before class on the day they are due. Students are encouraged to collaborate on problem sets, and to come to "work day" classes with ideas and questions.

**B. Final project** The focal experience of the class will be to develop a research project that addresses a biological or environmental question with data. Students will be expected to identify a question, contextualize the question with a literature review, locate data relevant to answering the question, and interpret and communicate that data with a workflow in R. It is expected that students integrate data from multiple sources. In general, students will be using public data, but if you have a data project of your own (particularly graduate students) we can discuss its suitability for this requirement. 

##Grade allocation
Grading will be based on a total of 200 points, where 90% of the points will earn an A, 80% a B, etc. Participation will reflect attendance and involvement in discussion and in-class exercises. The breakdown by assignments is as follows: 

Assignment| Points  
---|---
**4 Problem sets** (20 pts each) | 80 
**Final project**|
Part I: Literature review and proposed workflow | 30 
Part II: Peer review | 20 
Part III: Final paper | 40 
**Participation** | 30 


##Policies
1) Please note that assignments are due to Canvas before class. If an assignment is late, I will deduct 10% of the total points allocated to that assignment, and I will deduct 10% for each additional late day.

2) All missed classes need to be approved with the instructor prior to the start of class. Unexcused absences will result in the deduction of participation points. 

3) This class includes frequent in-class exercises and workdays. I expect all students to actively participate in exercises and discussions. 

4) We will follow school policy of plagiarism and academic dishonesty. All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code (https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-conduct/student-conduct-code).

5) Mac laptops will be provided for in-class use. The laptops wipe all personal data between classes and whenever you are logged off. Please don't log off the computers, and make sure to back up your work at the end of class. If you wish to use your own laptop please make sure to have R, RStudio and TeX installed. Most UO computers in computing labs have these programs installed, but please talk to me if you have trouble accessing computers or software out of class.

##Deadlines
Problem sets are due before class on:  
F 1/17 PS 1  
M 2/3 PS 2  
F 2/17 PS 3  
M 3/2 PS 4  

Final project due dates are:  
F 1/24 Topic proposed  
F 2/7 Data sources identified  
F 2/28 Literature review and workflow plan  
F 3/6 Peer review  
W 3/18 Final project  

##Course topics and tentative schedule
The topics on the tentative outline are subject to change. This is a guess, but we will take as long as needed on each lesson. Topics and lessons generally correspond to the noted chapter numbers in the book, additional readings will be posted to Canvas and emailed the week prior to when they should be read.
